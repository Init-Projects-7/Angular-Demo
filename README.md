# Create Angular Project Using Angular CLI

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Before creating an Angular project, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Step 2: Install Angular CLI
Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Angular CLI globally on your machine using npm. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This will install the latest version of Angular CLI.

## Step 3: Create a New Angular Project
After installing Angular CLI, you can now create a new Angular project by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```sh
ng new my-app
```


## Step 4: Navigate to the Project Folder
Once the project is created, navigate to the project folder using the following command:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Replace "my-app" with the name of your project.

## Step 5: Run the Development Server
To run the Angular development server, use the following command:

```sh
ng serve
```

This will start the development server and your Angular application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:4200/.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new Angular project using Angular CLI. You can now start building your Angular application by modifying the code in the generated project files.
